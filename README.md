# MyReads Project

This project is related to the first module of [Udacity's React Nanodegree](https://br.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

This project aims to create a bookshelf application that allows users to select and categorize books they have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using **React** to build the application.

This application allows the users to keep track of their own library, i.e., the user will be able to change a book status anytime, as well as add new titles to their collection or remove items from their library.

## Launch the Application

Before perform the commands to run the application, make sure you have [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed in your machine. 

So, to launch the application, just clone the repository, go to the folder in your local machine and perform the following commands below:

```bash
# Install all project dependencies
$ yarn install

# Launch the app
$ yarn start
```
If everything is fine, you will see a message like that below on the console:

```bash
Compiled successfully!

You can now view reactnd-myreads in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000/
```

Open the URL in our web browser and enjoy the application :)
